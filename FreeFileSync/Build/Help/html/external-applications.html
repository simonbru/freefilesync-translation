	<h1>External Applications</h1>

	<p>
		When you double-click on one of the rows on the main dialog, FreeFileSync opens the operating system's file browser 
		by default. On Windows it calls <span class="command-line">explorer /select, &quot;%local_path%&quot;</span>, on 
		Linux <span class="command-line">xdg-open &quot;%folder_path%&quot;</span> and on OS X <span class="command-line">open -R &quot;%local_path%&quot;</span>.
		To customize this behavior and integrate other external applications into FreeFileSync, 
		navigate to <b>Menu &rarr; Tools &rarr; Options &rarr; Customize context menu</b> and add or replace a command.
	</p>
		
	<p>
		The <b>first entry</b> will be executed when double-clicking a row on main grid or when pressing ENTER. All other entries can be accessed 		
		quickly by pressing the associated numeric keys or via the context menu that is shown after a right mouse click.
	</p>
		
	<p>
		In addition to regular <a href="macros.html">Macros</a>, the following special macros are available:

	<div class="greybox">
		<table style="border-spacing:0;">

				<th>Macro</th>

				<td>Full file or folder path</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><div class="command-line">%folder_path%</div></td>
				<td>Parent folder path</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><div class="command-line">%local_path%</div></td>
				<td>Creates a temporary local copy for files located on SFTP and MTP storage. Identical to %item_path% for files on local disks and network shares.</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
		<p>
			<b>Note:</b> To refer to the item on the opposite side, append "2" to the macro name: e.g.
			<span class="command-line">%item_path2%, %folder_path2%, %local_path2%</span>.
